# Parameter Details

## Configurations

The user can set the parameters in this section to enable (setting to `true`) or disable (setting to `false`) the components to be used in the `Configs` section.

For instance, if the background is clean, segmentation may not be needed and therefore can be disabled.

## Segmentation Parameters

This component of Cabana aims to extract collagen fibre areas determined by Picrosirius Red staining or SHG in an image from cluttered background based on colour and other low-level features. It relies on a self-supervised semantic segmentation model based on convolutional neural networks to group semantically similar neighbouring pixels. The mean colour of the pixels in the same segment will be compared with a user-specified threshold to determine whether the segment is the region of interest (ROI).

The following image segmentation parameters for ROI extraction can be adjusted:

1. **Number of Labels**

   The number of labels for semantic segmentation. It controls the level of granularity of segmentation. A higher number of labels will result in segments of smaller size. The default value is 32.

2. **Max Iterations**

   The maximal number of iterations for semantic segmentation. This value should be large enough to generate reliable segmentation results but not too high to avoid grouping all pixels into a single segment. The default value is 30.

3. **Normalized Hue Value**

   The normalized hue value in [0,1] for the colour of interest in HSB/HSV colour space. The typical hue values for green, blue, and red colour are 0.33, 0.66, and 1.0, respectively.

4. **Colour Threshold**

   Colour threshold used to determine ROI. Only segments with a mean colour greater than this threshold will be extracted as ROI. The default value is 0.25.

5. **Min Size**

   The minimal size of segments. Any segment with a size smaller than this parameter will be ignored. The default value is 64.

6. **Max Size**

   The maximum allowable image size. Any image with a size larger than the *square* of this parameter will be ignored by the program. The default value is 2048.

Note:

The program automatically detects whether the image is grayscale or in colour. If it's grayscale, it'll disregard the normalized hue value parameter and solely rely on the colour threshold for segmentation. To extract ROIs of colour images, you may need to adjust the Normalized Hue Value under the `Segmentation` tab or directly modify the `Segmentation` section in the exported `Parameters.yml` to optimise the parameters for your image**. To segment SHG images, it is recommended to increase the number of iterations from the default value 30 to 50. This needs to be tested and optimised by the user.

When the boundaries between regions of interest (SHG signal or Picrosirius Red areas) and background are not clearly distinguishable, obtaining satisfactory segmentation results can be difficult. To address this, the `Number of Labels` and `Max Iterations` parameters can be optimised. Increasing the number of labels generally leads to finer granularity in segmentations, which may result in a better segmentation result. Avoid increasing the number of labels beyond 64, otherwise GPU Memory might overflow. On the other hand, decreasing the max iterations may result in premature segmentation, reducing the likelihood of mixing fibres and background. Adjusting the HUE parameter may not have much of an effect as the colour of Picrosirius stained collagen fibres is already red/pink.

## Fibre Detection and Quantification

This component is designed to detect and quantify fibre structures in images. The file Parameters.yml contains three dedicated sections for controlling the outcomes of collagen fibre analysis:

1. **Detection**: Parameters for detecting fibres.
2. **Quantification**: Parameters for quantifying fibres.

### Detection

1. **Dark Line**

   Set to false = the program assumes that fibres are light on a dark background (fluorescence, birefringence, SHG etc).

   Set to true = Dark fibres on a light background (Picrosirius Red IHC).

2. **Min Line Width** $\mathbf{\omega}_{\mathbf{\min}}$

   It defines the minimum line (ridge) width in pixels that the ridge detection algorithm can detect. The line width $\omega$ is used to estimate the `Sigma` $\sigma$ parameter of Gaussian filtering kernel: $\sigma = \frac{\omega}{2\sqrt{3}} + 0.5$.

3. **Max Line Width** $\mathbf{\omega}_{\mathbf{\max}}$

   The maximum line (ridge) width in pixels that the ridge detection algorithm can detect.

   Twombli runs ridge detection repeatedly with every value between the minimum and maximum line width and calculates the combination of the detected ridges.

   Note:

   Setting a large line width (e.g., >15) gives rise to the chance of *straight line artefacts*, which are caused by the small (close to zero) upper threshold of filtering response.

4. **Line Width Step**

   This parameter controls the sampling factor for line widths between the minimum and the maximum line widths. It allows for increasing the line width by step larger than 1.

   For instance, if you want to detect ridges with multiple line widths 5, 7, and 9, you can specify a line width step to 2 with the min line width $\omega_{\min} = 5$ and the max line width $\omega_{\max} = 9$. The default value is 2.

5. **Low Contrast** $\mathbf{b}_{\mathbf{l}}$

   Defines the lowest grayscale contrast between a line (collagen fibre) and background (non-fibre area).

   This parameter is used to estimate the lower threshold for the filtering response: $T_{L} = \frac{0.17\omega b_{l}}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma^{3}}e^{- \frac{\omega^{2}}{8\sigma^{2}}}$. Line points with a filtering response lower than the low contrast threshold $T_{L}$ are discarded.

6. **High Contrast** $\mathbf{b}_{\mathbf{u}}$

   The highest grayscale contrast between a line (collagen fibre) and background (non-fibre area). This parameter is used to estimate the upper threshold for filtering response: $T_{U} = \frac{0.17\omega b_{u}}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma^{3}}e^{- \frac{\omega^{2}}{8\sigma^{2}}}$. Line points with a response larger than the high contrast threshold $T_{U}$ are accepted. Line points with a response in [$T_{L},\ T_{U}$] are added to the accepted line points if line structures are reasonably formed.

   Note:

   Not the absolute intensity is important, but the difference/contrast of a pixel with its neighbours. This applies to low and high contrast. 

   If a pixel with an intensity of 230 appears among neighbouring pixels with intensity of 230, the filtering response will be zero because this point is not visually salient. If this pixel appears among pixels with an intensity of 10, then the filtering response will be strong enough to signify it as a salient line/ridge point. For example, pixels values > 200 might or might not be accepted depending on their filtering responses. But the higher the contrast threshold, the criteria for a pixel becoming a line point becomes more stringent, therefore less line points will be detected. Also note that,
if the `Dark Line` is set to `true` (for Picrosirius Red), the low contrast and high contrast will be calculated as $255 - b_{u}$ and $255 - b_{l}$, respectively.

### Quantification

1. **Contrast Enhancement**

   A value between [0,1] shows the percent of pixels that will be saturated for contrast enhancement.

2. **Min/Max Curvature Window and Curvature Window Step**

   The curvature of ridges/lines in curvature windows bounded by the minimum and maximum curvature windows with a window step size.

3. **Minimum Branch Length**

   Any line/ridge with a length smaller than this value is ignored.

   Note: If the minimum branch length value is too low, short branch artefacts are introduced.

4. **Maximum Display HDM**

   Pixels not in [0, maxDisHDM] is set to 0 for estimating high-density matrix (HDM) area.

## Gap Analysis Parameters

1. **Minimum Gap Diameter**

   The minimal gap diameter for gap analysis.
