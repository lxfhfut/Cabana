# List of Cabana Read-outs (QuantificationResults.csv)

Values referring to *WIDTH*, *ROI* and *HDM* are based on the following outputs:

- WIDTH: Values based on ridge detection (found in images named \`\*\_Width.png\` within the `Exports` folder).
- ROI: Values based on segmented images (located in the `ROI` folder).
- HDM: Values derived from the High-Density Matrix (HDM), represented as non-black areas/pixels in images from the `HDM` folder.

| % HDM Area | Percentage of the image area covered by HDM. | High-density matrix areas are obtained using the following three steps: <br>1. Set pixels outside the range [0, maxDisHDM] to 0, where maxDisHDMis the value of `Maximum Display HDM` parameter specified in Parameters.yml<br>2. Apply contrast enhancement to the resultant image using the `Contrast Saturation` parameter specified in Parameters.yml.<br>3. Calculate % HDM as the portion of pixels in HDM area (% total area), where HDM areas are defined by the non-black pixels in the contrast enhanced image.                                                                                                                                  |

| Box-Counting Fractal Dimension | Indicator of structural complexity. Values in [1, 2] | It is an indicator for the capability of filling space. A more complex structure has a higher tendency to fill up the whole space, thus a higher fractal dimension.<br><br>The space filling tendency is measured as the slope of a linear fit to points represented as $(\log(1/\epsilon_{i}),\ \log(N(\epsilon_{i}))$ where $\epsilon_{i}\ $is the box size, and $N(\epsilon_{i})$ represents the count of boxes containing the structure (i.e. ridges). Typically, $\epsilon_{i}$ spans from 2 to one-quarter of the image\'s largest dimension. Refer to [here](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/fraclac/FLHelp/BoxCounting.htm) for more information. |
